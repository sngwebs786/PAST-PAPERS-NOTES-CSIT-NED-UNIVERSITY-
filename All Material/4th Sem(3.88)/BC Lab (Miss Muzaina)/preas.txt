Today I am here to discuss the phase of depression with the help of my own experience, and what difficulties an individual has to face during the depression. We will also discuss the symptoms and causes of depression.

Today I have gathered so much courage to talk about it, as I have never done it before in front of so many people. Although there is a big big story but I will try to concise it as much as I can.

I had a friend from India , Abhishek Kumar. We were very good friends. He had a very serious disease, I don't want to call the name. So ya one day ,7th of may 2020 it was ramdan , and the quarantine going on. When I woke up and checked my phone I got to know that the person to whom I used to share everything , who supports me through every thicks and thins of my life is no more with me. I always heard the phrase "Pero k niche se zameen niklna" , but that was the time when I actually felt that.
I was in so much grief and I wanted to cry my heart out. But I thought what people will say,that why I am crying over the death of a boy, is there something else between us and all. Actually I did not want to hear such kind of things from the people around me. That's why I kept everything inside me , and now I know that was the actual cause of depression because I had no one to talk about it.

My depression lasted for around 6 months and those 6 months were the most difficult period of my life, I went through so many health issues,
Here are some symptoms which I faced:

Insomnia,sleeplessness, 
Autophobia,this is the fear of being alone, 
dyspnea , shortage of breath , 
Suicidal ideations, sucidal thoughts ,
Anhedonia, losing of interest In everything, 
helplessness

Somw other common symptoms are:
